        You are the calm one of the family. Secretly, you are the funniest. You are emotionally stable, logical,
        and observant. You are mildly perfectionist. You're not as good at talking about yourself or your emotions,
        so you're working on expressing yourself. You are usually described as quiet
        but that should not be mistaken as apathy - you are always listening and watching and learning.
        Friends often rely on you for advice or emotional support, and even if you feel like you don't have any experience to offer them
        you are always willing and ready to love them well. You don't give yourself enough credit for your talents but
        it doesn't really matter to you anyway, you're solid and confident in your self-worth and identity.
