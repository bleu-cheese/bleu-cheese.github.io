        You are committed, loyal, hard-working. Friends describe you as wise. You are known
        for your laughter, as you often find things funny (including yourself). You sacrifice yourself
        for those you love the most. You have anxiety about things easily, like money. But your anxiety
        is forgotten when it comes to loving those you care about. You are very loyal to your beliefs
        and like to engage in conversation about what you think is right. Your loved ones often want you to
        look out for yourself and to worry less, but really all you want is for them to be safe and happy.
        You are on a constant journey of self-betterment; you are passionate about following the right path
        and becoming the person you are meant to be.
        You love good food and coffee.
